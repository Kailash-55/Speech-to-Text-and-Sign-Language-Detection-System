Programming is like giving instructions to a computer. Just like you follow steps to make a sandwich, computers follow steps to do tasks.

What is a Program?
A program is a list of instructions that tells the computer what to do.

Simple Example:
Imagine telling a robot to make tea:
1. Take a cup
2. Add water
3. Heat the water
4. Add tea bag
5. Wait 3 minutes
6. Remove tea bag

That's programming! You give clear steps, one at a time.

Key Words to Remember:
- Code: The instructions we write
- Program: A complete set of instructions
- Computer: The machine that follows our instructions

Fun Fact: Computers are very fast but not smart - they only do exactly what we tell them!""",
            'content_medium': """Introduction to Programming Concepts

Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are written in programming languages.

Core Concepts:

1. Variables - Storage boxes for data
   Example: name = "Alice"
   This stores the text "Alice" in a box called "name"

2. Data Types - Different kinds of information
   - Numbers: 1, 2, 3.14
   - Text (Strings): "Hello World"
   - True/False (Boolean): True, False

3. Input/Output
   - Input: Getting information from the user
   - Output: Showing results to the user

4. Sequence
   - Instructions run one after another, top to bottom

Simple Python Example:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

This program asks for your name and greets you.

Programming Languages:
- Python (beginner-friendly)
- JavaScript (for websites)
- Java (for applications)
- C++ (for games and systems)""",

Programming extends beyond syntax to encompass problem-solving methodologies and computational thinking.

Computational Thinking Components:
1. Decomposition - Breaking complex problems into smaller parts
2. Pattern Recognition - Identifying similarities and trends
3. Abstraction - Focusing on essential information
4. Algorithm Design - Creating step-by-step solutions

Programming Paradigms:

1. Procedural Programming
   - Sequential execution of instructions
   - Functions for code reuse
   - Example: C, Pascal

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Data and functions bundled as objects
   - Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - Example: Java, Python, C++

3. Functional Programming
   - Pure functions without side effects
   - Immutable data
   - Example: Haskell, Lisp

4. Event-Driven Programming
   - Program flow determined by events
   - Common in GUI and web applications

Code Quality Principles:
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It

Version Control:
Git is essential for tracking changes and collaboration.
Basic commands: git init, git add, git commit, git push"""

What is a Variable?
A variable is like a labeled box where we store information.

Imagine you have boxes at home:
- A box labeled "Toys" for your toys
- A box labeled "Books" for your books

In programming:
- age = 10 (a box called "age" holding the number 10)
- name = "Sam" (a box called "name" holding the text "Sam")

Types of Data:

1. Numbers
   - Whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, 100
   - Decimal numbers: 3.14, 2.5

2. Text (Words)
   - "Hello"
   - "My name is Sam"

3. Yes or No (True/False)
   - Is it raining? True or False

Simple Example:
my_age = 12
my_name = "Jordan"
loves_coding = True

Variables store data that can change during program execution. Data types define what kind of data can be stored.

Primitive Data Types:

1. Integer (int)
   - Whole numbers without decimals
   - Example: age = 25, count = -10

2. Float/Double
   - Decimal numbers
   - Example: price = 19.99, pi = 3.14159

3. String (str)
   - Text enclosed in quotes
   - Example: message = "Hello World"

4. Boolean (bool)
   - True or False values
   - Example: is_active = True

5. Character (char)
   - Single character
   - Example: grade = 'A'

Variable Naming Rules:
- Start with letter or underscore
- No spaces (use_underscores or camelCase)
- Case-sensitive (Name != name)
- Avoid reserved keywords

Type Conversion:
- str(100) converts 100 to "100"
- int("50") converts "50" to 50
- float("3.14") converts to 3.14

Constants:
Values that don't change, often in UPPERCASE:

Understanding data types at a deeper level involves memory allocation, type systems, and data structures.

Type Systems:

1. Static Typing (Java, C++)
   - Types checked at compile time
   - int age = 25;
   - Catches errors early

2. Dynamic Typing (Python, JavaScript)
   - Types checked at runtime
   - age = 25  # type inferred
   - More flexible but potential runtime errors

3. Strong vs Weak Typing
   - Strong: Strict type enforcement (Python)
   - Weak: Implicit type conversion (JavaScript)

Memory Representation:
- int (32-bit): -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- long (64-bit): Much larger range
- float (32-bit): ~7 decimal digits precision
- double (64-bit): ~15 decimal digits precision

Reference Types:
- Objects, Arrays, Strings (in some languages)
- Stored on heap, variable holds memory address
- Garbage collection manages deallocation

Type Annotations (Python 3.5+):
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"

Nullable Types:
- Optional values that can be None/null
- TypeScript: string | null
- Kotlin: String?

Immutability:
- Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation
- Strings in Python are immutable
- Benefits: Thread safety, predictability"""

Databases provide structured data storage with powerful query capabilities.

Relational Database Components:

1. Tables (Relations):
   - Rows (Records/Tuples)
   - Columns (Fields/Attributes)

2. Primary Key:
   - Unique identifier for each row
   - Cannot be NULL

3. Foreign Key:
   - References primary key in another table
   - Creates relationships between tables

SQL - Structured Query Language:

SELECT:
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE grade = 10;
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;

INSERT:
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES ('David', 16, 11);

UPDATE:
UPDATE students SET grade = 11 WHERE name = 'Alice';

DELETE:
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;

JOINs - Combining Tables:
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id
JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.id;

Types of Joins:
- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
- LEFT JOIN: All from left + matches
- RIGHT JOIN: All from right + matches
- FULL JOIN: All rows from both

Aggregate Functions:
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

GROUP BY:

Professional database work requires understanding normalization, indexing, and transaction management.

Database Normalization:

1NF (First Normal Form):
- Atomic values (no lists in cells)
- Unique column names
- Same data type in column

2NF (Second Normal Form):
- 1NF + no partial dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend on entire key

3NF (Third Normal Form):
- 2NF + no transitive dependencies
- Non-key attributes depend only on key

BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):
- Every determinant is a candidate key

Indexing:
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON students(name);

Types:
- B-Tree: Default, good for ranges
- Hash: Exact matches only
- Composite: Multiple columns

Trade-offs:
- Speeds up SELECT
- Slows down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- Uses storage space

Transactions (ACID):
- Atomicity: All or nothing
- Consistency: Valid state to valid state
- Isolation: Concurrent transactions isolated
- Durability: Committed data persists

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

Query Optimization:
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see query plan
- Avoid SELECT * in production
- Use indexes appropriately
- Denormalize for read-heavy loads

What is OOP?
OOP is a way to organize code using "objects" - like real things in the world!

Real World Example:
Think about a Dog:
- Properties: name, color, age
- Actions: bark, run, eat

In code, we create a "blueprint" (class) for dogs:

class Dog:
    name = "Buddy"
    color = "brown"
    
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

Creating Objects:
my_dog = Dog()
my_dog.bark()  # Woof!

Objects are like copies made from the blueprint.

Why Use OOP?
1. Organize code like real things
2. Reuse code easily
3. Hide complex details
4. Work in teams better

Key Ideas:
- Class: The blueprint (recipe)
- Object: The actual thing (the cake)
- Properties: What it has (ingredients)
- Methods: What it does (baking steps)

It's like building with LEGO - you create pieces (classes) and combine them!""",
            'content_medium': """Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

OOP organizes code around objects that combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Classes and Objects:

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}!"

# Creating objects (instances)
alice = Student("Alice", 20)
bob = Student("Bob", 22)

print(alice.introduce())  # Hi, I'm Alice!

Four Pillars of OOP:

1. Encapsulation:
   - Bundle data with methods
   - Hide internal details
   - Public/private access
   
   class BankAccount:
       def __init__(self):
           self.__balance = 0  # Private
       
       def deposit(self, amount):
           if amount > 0:
               self.__balance += amount

2. Inheritance:
   - Create new classes from existing ones
   - Child inherits from parent
   
   class Animal:
       def speak(self):
           pass
   
   class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof!"

3. Polymorphism:
   - Same interface, different behaviors
   
   animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
   for animal in animals:
       print(animal.speak())  # Different sounds

4. Abstraction:
   - Hide complexity
   - Show only necessary details
   - Abstract classes/interfaces

Constructor (__init__):
- Called when object is created
- Initializes attributes

self Parameter:
- Reference to current instance
- Always first parameter in methods""",
            'content_advanced': """Advanced OOP and Design Patterns

Professional OOP requires understanding design principles and patterns for maintainable, scalable code.

SOLID Principles:

S - Single Responsibility:
   Each class has one job

O - Open/Closed:
   Open for extension, closed for modification

L - Liskov Substitution:
   Subtypes must be substitutable for base types

I - Interface Segregation:
   Many specific interfaces over one general

D - Dependency Inversion:
   Depend on abstractions, not concretions

Abstract Classes and Interfaces:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

Design Patterns:

Creational:
- Singleton: One instance only
- Factory: Create objects without specifying class
- Builder: Construct complex objects step by step

Structural:
- Adapter: Make incompatible interfaces work together
- Decorator: Add behavior dynamically
- Facade: Simplified interface to complex system

Behavioral:
- Observer: Notify dependents of changes
- Strategy: Interchangeable algorithms
- Command: Encapsulate requests as objects

Composition over Inheritance:
- Favor composing objects over deep hierarchies
- More flexible and maintainable

class Engine:
    def start(self): pass

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Composition

Multiple Inheritance:
class FlyingCar(Car, Airplane):
    pass

Method Resolution Order (MRO):
- Python uses C3 linearization
- Use super() for cooperative inheritance"""
